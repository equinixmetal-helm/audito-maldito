A Helm chart for deploying [audito-maldito][audito-maldito] in Kubernetes.
This chart is provided and maintained by your friends at Equinix Metal.

[audito-maldito]: https://github.com/metal-toolbox/audito-maldito

## Usage

audito-maldito is deployed as a [daemonset][daemonset]. This includes
several containers:

- `audito-maldito` - The containerized audito-maldito process. It reads from
  data sources using named pipes provided via a shared volume
- `rsyslog` - A containerized rsyslog process that reads log messages from
  OpenSSH daemon and other sources and writes them to named pipes.
  The named pipes are shared with audito-maldito via a shared volume
- `audittail` - A containerized Go program that reads audito-maldito's
  audit events and writes them to stdout

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)

### Testing

Ensure that the documentation is up to date before pushing a pull request:

```bash
helm-docs
```

### Releasing

There is a useful Makefile target that's useful to cut a release. So, simply do:

```bash
TAG=$RELEASE_VERSION make release
```

And the release will happen.

Note that this project follows the [Semantic Versioning scheme](https://semver.org/), so
make sure to follow it when cutting releases.

The `TAG` Makefile variable takes a release version without the `v` prefix. For example,
if you want to cut a release with version `v1.2.3`, you'd do:

```bash
TAG=1.2.3 make release
```
